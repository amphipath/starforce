Please make sure of the following:

* Hybrid Logic, Pirate's Blessing, Cygnus' Blessing are **unequipped**
* You have **an empty link skill slot** available to equip these skills
* (optional if not interested in calculating %ATT equivalence) Echo of Hero (or your class' equivalent) is **off cooldown**, and not currently buffed on your character

We will be recording some numbers after equipping and unequipping link skills to do these calculations. **Please ensure that these numbers are all taken in the same conditions**. The easiest way to do this would be to make sure Ark link is at 0 stacks, and have everything self-buffed only, but I suppose if you're fast you can calculate equivalences during burst too.
